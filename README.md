# About

A simple task tracker, built as a tutorial project to learn React. See the tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8&t=1794s

# Outcome

Learned the basics of working with components, props and state. Also practiced accessing a mock back-end API with json-server, and creating routes using react-router-dom.
